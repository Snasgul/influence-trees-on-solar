# leaf-density
If you have pictures of a tree and you know the position of this picture, you can conclude how much sunlight comes through the tree. First you need pictures of the tree from all directions from different distances. The tree is cropped against the background to determine the shadow. Then the images are combined to calculate the shadow between the images.
The sun is not a point source but is about 0.5Â°. When an object shadows the sun, there is always an unaffected part, a penumbra and a total shadow.
